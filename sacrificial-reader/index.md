# Merging with the Network

**Life Sharing (2000–2003) is an epic work by Eva and Franco Mattes (0100101110101101.ORG), originally commissioned by the Walker Art Center. For three years, the artists openly shared their home computer, making its contents accessible on the internet. Private material, including email, texts, photos, and bank statements, was freely available through their website.**

**As the artists worked directly on the shared computer, it functioned more like a web server, with the invited public “occupying” their home—the actual hardware was located in the artists’ bedroom. Interactions happened in real-time, and the public were invited to copy anything that they found.**

**Paul Soulellis:** Network culture at the turn of the century was somewhere between the ideology of the early internet and our current corporate state reality—we were in the full throes of blogging, camming, and the first dot com boom, but social media and the iPhone were still on the horizon (as was 9/11). You launched Life Sharing on 01/01/01, and there was an immediate, voyeuristic fascination with this idea of two young artists exposing their lives online through their own computer. What were your thoughts about privacy at that time? What were you hoping to explore with the project?

**Eva and Franco Mattes (0100101110101101.ORG):** In the ’90s there was this widespread idea of “merging with the network.” It may have come from the novel Neuromancer, which we were very much influenced by. So we’d sit in front of computers for our waking hours. We’d sleep during the day and live at night, to not get distracted by “the real world.” People thought we were crazy, that it was totally insane to stare at a monitor for days, weeks and months, as if you’d ever sit in front of the TV for three years. We also weren’t sure if it was a good idea; it definitely wasn’t a healthy lifestyle. But intuitively we understood that this would be the future, and we wanted to be there as early as possible. If life was going to be like this, we thought, we’d better do it now, because we were curious to see what would come next. And Life Sharing is what was next for us—a glimpse into that expected future.

We had very conflicting feelings about privacy. On the one hand, rationally, we were aware that the internet could massively increase surveillance, and that every communication was virtually archived somewhere. Even by using credit cards, we were making it incredibly simple for companies and governments to profile users with surgical precision. We were aware of the cryptography struggle. That’s probably why the computer was filled with references to the surveillance state: the main section was called Glasnost; other sections were called Stasi, Vopos. Among the few photos stored in the computer were shots of East Berlin that we had found on the internet.

On the other hand, we intuited that the idea of privacy itself was slowly becoming obsolete—that a computer connected to the internet was an instrument that allows for the free flow of information. That was its aim, and anything blocking the free flow was an obstacle to overcome. That’s why we had this slogan “Privacy is stupid.”

**PS:** How did copyright come into play?

**E&FM:** In addition to accessing everything on our computer, viewers could also copy everything that they saw. Our novelist friends Wu Ming, who were a huge influence on us, had widely published, very successful no-copyright novels, and we had just discovered Linux and this burgeoning open source movement, so we thought, if it works for software, and even novels, why not try applying it to art?

We took the classic hacker slogan "information wants to be free," and tried to embody it, to live by it, and discover the consequences when this is actually done in practice, when it's interpreted literally: share everything, for free, every day.

So there was also a more utopian side to it; you have to consider that social networks didn’t really exist yet. On Life Sharing you couldn't buy or sell anything, no data mining, no profiling, no information extraction … just pure sharing.

**PS:** Hito Steyerl once called Life Sharing “abstract pornography,” and Steve Dietz (former curator of new media at the Walker Art Center) compared it to Philip Johnson’s Glass House. How were intimacy and exposure part of the project?

**E&FM:** A lot of people have used sexual references when discussing the work. Matthew Fuller, for example, called it “Data nudism,” and the words most often used were voyeurism and exibitionism. We didn’t have a studio, so the server was physically located in our bedroom—we were literally sleeping with the server noises and the LED lights endlessly blinking a few inches from our bed. But, like Hito so brilliantly put it, with all its “radical transparency,” it was also very abstract. It had nothing to do with other more titillating experiments happening in the same period, with people living 24-7 in front of webcams, etc. In fact, there were very few images and videos in our computer, as smartphones didn’t exist. So the focus of the work was definitely data, more than bodies.

I think the sense of intimacy people felt may have come from the fact that the content they’d see had not been edited—we showed everything, in real time, and the content was not formatted or designed. Naked data without interface. Check the mail archive—three-fourths of it is spam—so you get a realistic view of what working with computers looks like, not the idealized or sanitized version companies want to show us, but the dirtiness and busyness of someone's life.

Life Sharing was structured like all computers, with folders containing files (images, texts, or code), and more subfolders containing more files and more subfolders. Everything was very simple but also raw; there was no user-friendly interface with links to the content. The only modification we made to the server structure was to impose random visuals to every directory, so that a different background color and graphic was seen each time. This didn’t affect the content; it was just dynamically generated on the background.

**PS:** Even though you were working with a massive amount of content, Life Sharing had an ephemeral, temporal quality to it—information coming and going, minute by minute.

**E&FM:** There are more than one hundred thousand files. I myself don’t know everything in there. Still today when I open it I find things I had forgotten about. A lot of the content is not even ours. Back then, whenever we found something interesting, we’d save it in our computer; there are hundreds of articles, essays, and websites by other artists, which we copied. You never knew if the website would still be there tomorrow. Maybe it would move somewhere else, or it would disappear; maybe the whole internet would suddenly disappear? It was not clear to me how permanent this internet thing was.

When you’d enter our website, an alert would pop up saying, “Now you’re in my computer,” to make it clear, even to a random visitor, that this was something different from other websites. It was our personal computer, and you were entering a very intimate space. From the viewer’s perspective, it’s like entering someone’s private life, as if you were stealing a stranger’s computer and reading their emails and rummaging through all their files, looking for something interesting, or as if you entered someone’s house and started looking in the drawers … there’s definitely a voyeuristic feeling to the experience, that the viewer felt while spending time on our computer.

# The Cloud

There's something comforting about the wispy metaphor for the network that underpins most aspects of our daily lives. It's easy to forget the reality of its vast physical infrastructure.

The "cloud" in cloud computing has its origins in the network diagrams of early telecommunications engineers. Drawn freehand, a little puff of semicircles, a thought bubble, it denotes the point at which the responsibility of the engineer ceases. That stuff over there, which we don't need to think about. Everything in the cloud is invisible; and somebody else's problem.

With the advent of digital networks, the cloud quickly came to denote the internet, the worldwide network of networks that is also somebody else's problem. You can ask the cloud questions, and the cloud answers. All is well and good. Sometimes the cloud doesn't answer, and you have to dig up a road. Beneath the paving stones, the cloud.

But some time around the mid-1990s, the cloud changed. A 1996 internal document from computer company Compaq was titled "Internet Solutions Division Strategy for Cloud Computing". Whether it was the first use of the term is disputed, but it states that in the future "application software is no longer a feature of the hardware – but of the Internet".

What had changed was that the network had stopped being a mere communication channel, and had become a place for computation and storage. By the mid-noughties it was a marketing buzzword, and today it is a fact of life. We have designed our lives around this ever-available, practically infinite and startlingly remote storage capacity. As smart as the phones in our pockets are, most of what they tell us is calculated and held in the cloud.

A 2012 survey by cloud corp Citrix stated that, from a base of 1,000 respondents, 95 per cent didn't believe they used the cloud, and 95 per cent of them actually did. From Gmail to the Amazon wishlist, most of your emails, photos, status updates, business documents, library and voting data, health records, credit rating, likes, experiences and personal preferences are in the cloud. And that cloud belongs to someone.

The cloud is not some magical faraway place made of water vapour and radio waves where everything just works. It is a physical infrastructure consisting of phone lines, fibre optics, satellites, cables on the ocean floor, and vast warehouses filled with computers, which consume huge amounts of water and energy, and reside within national and legal jurisdictions. There's a reason Google and Facebook like to build data centres in Ireland (tax) and Scandinavia (cheap energy, and it's cold). The cloud doesn't just have a shadow, it has a footprint.

Yet it is still "somebody else's problem". The cloud is both an inherently distancing metaphor and a potentially harmful one. The computer in your pocket was designed in California, mined in Canada, assembled in China, shipped via god-knows-where, and allows you to see and contact any point on the planet, and even the satellites orbiting above it.

The cloud obscures these relationships, but if we poke it, it also reveals them in ways that were not possible to see before. That anonymous shed on the ring road is the new civic sphere; it's the place where we shop, bank, socialise and vote. To truly perceive and understand the implications of this is central to the design and architecture of the future. The network is crying out for better metaphors.
