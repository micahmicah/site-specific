- title: "House Passes Budget Blueprint, Clearing Path for Tax Overhaul"
  fragment: "Those ambitions are already complicated by difficult math, 
  both in terms of tax revenues and vote counts. The budget vote put 
  those competing factors on display, with 20 Republicans defecting and 
  the resolution narrowly passing, 216 to 212, in part over concerns about 
  the possible elimination of a tax break that disproportionately benefits 
  residents of high-tax states. A potential reduction in contribution 
  limits for 401(k) retirement accounts also appears to be stoking an 
  intraparty fight."

- title: "Can the Media Survive on this path?"
  fragment: "But there are miles to go. Reversing 
  the path they’re on would require a significant internal 
  overhaul by the nation’s leading media organizations. Doing so could 
  help them regain their lost credibility and restore the majority of 
  Americans’ faith in them as unbiased arbiters of truth and evenhanded 
  watchdogs of government. And, who knows, it might even make Schumer 
  and Pelosi relevant again."

  many of us couldn’t care less what they think.. Andrew Breitbart warned of how 
  much we were hated in this town, and set up Big Hollywood to even the playing 
  field. And as the New York Times puts it – we’ve been “perfecting the art” of 
  weaponizing their own words against them ever since."

- title: "Reprogramming Decisionism"
  fragment: "Post-truth politics is the art of relying on affective predispositions or 
  reactions already known or expressed to stage old beliefs as though they were new. 
  Algorithms are said to capitalize on these predispositions or reactions recorded as 
  random data traces left when we choose this or that music track, this or that pair of 
  shorts, this or that movie streaming website. In other words, the post-truth computation 
  machine does not follow its own internal, binary logic of either/or, but follows 
  instead whatever logic we leave enclosed within our random selections. To the extent 
  that post-truth politics has a computational machine, then, this machine is no 
  longer digital, because it is no longer concerned with verifying and explaining problems. 
  The logic of this machine has instead gone meta-digital because it is no longer 
  concerned with the correlation between truths or ideas on the one hand, and proofs 
  or facts on the other, but is instead overcome by a new level of automated communication 
  enabled by the algorithmic quantification of affects."

  smudge our papers! In fact, the blue part of the eraser was designed to get rid of pencil 
  marks on art and graphic papers because they are softer and more sensitive."

  headrest, there is one more use that many may have neglected. In an unfortunate 
  scenario where you are trapped in your car and desperately need to get out, all you 
  have to do is remove the headrest and wedge it into the window sill of your car. 
  Make sure the metal tongs are wedged into the window, and by cranking it lightly, 
  the window will shatter allowing you to make a hasty escape."
