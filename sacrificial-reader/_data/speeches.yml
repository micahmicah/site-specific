  speech:
  - line: "Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, "
  - line: "a new nation, "
  - line: "conceived in Liberty, "
  - line: "and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal."
  - line: "Now we are engaged in a great civil war, "
  - line: "testing whether that nation, "
  - line: "or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, "
  - line: "can long endure. "
  - line: "We are met on a great battle-field of that war."
  - line: " We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. "
  - line: "It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this."
  - line: "But, in a larger sense,"
  - line: "we can not dedicate —"
  - line: "we can not consecrate —"
  - line: "we can not hallow —"
  - line: "this ground."
  - line: "The brave men,"
  - line: "living and dead,"
  - line: "who struggled here,"
  - line: "have consecrated it,"
  - line: "far above our poor power to add or detract."
  - line: "The world will little note,"
  - line: "nor long remember what we say here,"
  - line: "but it can never forget what they did here."
  - line: "It is for us the living,"
  - line: "rather,"
  - line: "to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced."
  - line: "It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us —"
  - line: "that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion — "
  - line: "that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain —"
  - line: "that this nation,"
  - line: "under God,"
  - line: "shall have a new birth of freedom —"
  - line: "and that government of the people,"
  - line: "by the people,"
  - line: "for the people,"
  - line: "shall not perish from the earth."
